## Why vybn

Claude Code runs best with a stable, always-on environment. Running it on a cloud VM gives you:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Persistent sessions" icon="laptop">
    tmux keeps Claude Code running even when you disconnect. Reconnect from any device and pick up exactly where you left off.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistent environment" icon="setting">
    Same OS, same tools, no laptop-specific quirks. Choose your toolchains — Node.js, Python, Rust, Go, Docker — and get a consistent dev environment every time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multiple projects" icon="list-format">
    Each project runs in its own tmux window, all on one VM. Switch between them instantly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Low cost" icon="approve-check">
    Stop the VM when not in use. Pay only for disk storage (~$5.10/month for 30 GB SSD).
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick look

```bash
# Configure your VM (network, project, machine type, etc.)
vybn init

# Deploy a VM with Claude Code pre-installed
vybn deploy

# Connect to a persistent session
vybn connect
```

That's it. Three commands to get a persistent Claude Code environment in the cloud. vybn uses Tailscale by default, so your VM is reachable from any device on your tailnet — including phones and tablets.
