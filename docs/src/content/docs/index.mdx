## Why vybn

Claude Code runs best with a stable, always-on environment. Running it on a cloud VM gives you:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Three commands to running" icon="rocket">
    Configure, deploy, connect — that's it. A setup wizard handles the rest. Claude Code is running in minutes, not hours.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Always-on sessions" icon="laptop">
    Close your laptop, come back tomorrow — Claude keeps working. Sessions persist across disconnects so you never lose progress.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Connect from any device" icon="phone">
    Prompt Claude from your phone on the train, pick up results on your laptop at the desk. One session, every screen.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Your cloud, your rules" icon="setting">
    Pick your machine size, toolchains, and packages. Stop the VM when idle — pay only for what you use.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick look

```bash
# Configure your VM (network, project, machine type, etc.)
vybn init

# Deploy a VM with Claude Code pre-installed
vybn deploy

# Connect to a persistent session
vybn connect
```

That's it. Three commands to get a persistent Claude Code environment in the cloud. vybn uses Tailscale by default, so your VM is reachable from any device on your tailnet — including phones and tablets.
